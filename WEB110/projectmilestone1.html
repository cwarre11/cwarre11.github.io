				<strong>What is the purpose of the site? What do you want the website to accomplish? What opportunity, problem, or issue is your site addressing?:</strong>
					When I tell people that I work for Amazon I usually get asked how it is. Most people have heard that they are an awful company to work for so I don't blame them for wanting to know. This website will tell the few of you in my class how working for Amazon really is.
			</li>

				<strong>Who is your intended audience? Be specific:</strong>
					Anyone wanting to know about working for Amazon.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>What type of content might be included in your site? Be specific:</strong>
					To give an unbiased opinion from someone who actually works for the company. Online when you see articles either for why Amazon is great to work for or why they are terrible, it's usually from a journalist who just asks other people about Amazon. Some things are great at Amazon and some are terrible, I'll be addressing both sides.
