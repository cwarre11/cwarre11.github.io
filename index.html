				<strong>Personal Background:</strong>
					I'm from Decatur, Illinois. I grew up there and lived there all the way up until May of 2019. I flew out here for a car show in October of 2018 and decided I was going to move here. I'm 22 years old and dropped out of college at 19 in Illinois. I had been looking for a reason to go back to school so I decided moving halfway across the country by myself would be a good reason.

				<strong>Professional Background:</strong>
					I currently work at Amazon in Concord, but I have been working at a few different jobs since I was 16.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Academic Background:</strong>
					I graduated from Warrensburg-Latham High School in 2016 and that fall I started attending school at Parkland College. I only finished my freshman year and never went back. Now I'm on my second year at CPCC working towards a Full Stack Programming degree.

				<strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>
					I do most of my homework on a laptop running Windows but I take most of my notes on a Chromebook because I like the smaller keyboard.
